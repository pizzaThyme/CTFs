Starting out easy
The task is to find a flag hidden within the metadata of the pdf file.

Opened up the pdf file to find not much of importance. Just a standard pdf. 

There are multiple ways to find metadata, but from the browser, you can simply go to 
https://exif.tools/upload.php for a quick glance at the data.

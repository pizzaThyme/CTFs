Based on the challenge file and information provided, this looks to be a simple, fun challenge. 

Our goal is to guess a rotating number 1-1000, and we only get 10 tries.

So we can pretty easily narrow down our choices once we connect to the Pico server.

On my first try, I tried to overshoot 500 to try and get it in less tries, but I ended up being off by *ONE* number...

It's okay though, trying this one again, I was able to grab the flag by using the same elimination technique to grab the flag.

This was a pretty fun logic game (at least it gave me a breather from the reverse engineering headache-inducing challenges) :) picoCTF{REDACTED}

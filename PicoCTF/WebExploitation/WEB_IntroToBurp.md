This challenge does not give us much information to start with, so let's start up burpsuite.

If you are not familiar, burp is a proxy that you can use to intercept requests (http traffic in this case) and manipulate what is sent to the server. 

When you go to the site, you are met with a basic registration page, so go ahead and fill out this page with some basic information. 

The next page is really interesting. We are met with a "2FA OTP" form that we must fill out. 

I tried putting in several different numbers and text into the page form, but all I received was "Invalid OTP".

Let's start capturing the requests and manipulating them.

I also tried changing the request to only send "otp=", but this also resulted in "Invalid OTP". 

So, my red herring was to try and brute force the request using BurpSuite Intruder using the sniper option to change the OTP field.

The typical MFA request that I've seen is 6 digits, so we can take the following command to create a file with all the 6 digit numbers:

> seq -w 0 999999 > otpBruteForce.txt

The "-w" will pad the numbers with leading zeros so they are all 6 digits. It could theoretically be done using Intruder and changing the OTP field using this file, but I didn't want to brute force attack Pico's server.

Looking at a hint, we now know it should be as easy as changing the fields. What if we removed the "OTP" field completely from the request?

Ah, much easier and less time-consuming than trying to brute-force! picoCTF{REDACTED}

Our description for the challenge asks, "Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy?"

When we connect to the server, we can try inputting the different options for Patrick to try. The first and last options don't work.

When we try the second option, we can see that the "%1" in the input field causes some weird things to happen with the output.

Looking at the code, we can see that "%s" is called in the printf functions of the file. We can use what we now know is a format string function to find the flag!

Once we move on to the second set of options, we can move on to type out "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak" for the order. 

The program then takes our input and outputs the data twice, leading to  our format string vulnerability and our flag! picoCTF{REDACTED}

# CTFs
tools, techniques, and writeups of CTFs

This is a repo of writeup from previous CTFs that I have participated in. Enjoy! 

I will refrain from posting the actual flag for ongoing CTFs (such as PicoCTF), but I will post the flag for completed CTFs, so no spoilers.
I also plan on writing my thought process, any tools or techniques used, red herrings, and (hopefully) a flag 
from time to time.

Happy hunting, and I hope you learn a thing or two with me along the way. :)
